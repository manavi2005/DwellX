DwellX is a consolidated platform to check ratings of districts in Chicago based on certain demographic and infrastructure metrics in order to determine an appropriate place for newcomers to live. It aims to assist newcomers in finding places to live by considering metrics such as house prices, high school ratings, crime rates, political affiliation, employment rates, and more. These metrics would then be used to rank each county from best to worst place to live based on user preferences.
The user will be able to create an account and choose which metrics are most important to them. Whether they value housing prices or schools rankings more, DwellX will be able to suggest ideal places for the user to live, while catering to their individual needs.
